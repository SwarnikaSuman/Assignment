    <p>Smart Living is a trend encompassing advancements that give people the opportunity to benefit from new ways of living. It involves original and innovative solutions aimed at making life more efficient, more controllable, economical, productive, integrated and sustainable. Smart Living also helps expand the world’s understanding of how people and technology interact. It’s more than just creating sustainable homes. It means developing intelligent systems that will change the future of everyday life. </p><p> term “smart living” is often mentioned in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT) or Smart Home. Smart living promises more comfort, security and energy efficiency in our everyday life through digitalization and the inter-connectivity of devices. But smart living has even more potential than just connecting devices with each other. Smart Homes were in the past viewed as a luxury, with their primary purpose being to serve as a show piece for the owners. This reality has changed substantially, both because of the development of newer technologies like Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), and also because of simultaneously occurring social changes that are occurring in our everyday lives. </p><p>The confluence of many socio-economic factors in conjunction with the evolving technologies may serve as the break out recipe, for Smart Living to significantly increase their presence and get integrated into our daily lives. IoT refers to the technology that enables devices to communicate over the internet, so that they can either be controlled remotely or can send information about their status to a remote user. These are usually electrical devices that range from simple lighting, fans, ACs, Washing Machines, Refrigerators etc. within homes to more heavy electrical devices that exist in buildings such as Pumps or Fire panels. In the case of businesses these can be fairly large machinery that communicates this was as well, such as MRI equipment or printers. </p><p> AI on the other hand refers to Artificial Intelligence, which typically amongst other things means a capability that is able to perform certain tasks automatically for the user. The ability to perform the tasks automatically is largely dependent on the data that the system has collected and has ’learned from’ or been ‘trained on’ using a variety of machine learning or deep learning algorithms. Some examples of smart living are :- Fitness trackers, smart pharmaceutical packaging, adhesive solar films or steplessly dimmable windows etc.</p>
